xbbcode.js
==========

This is a JavaScript version of [XBBCode](https://drupal.org/project/xbbcode).

xbbcode parses arbitrary text to find a properly nested tree of BBCode tags in
square brackets, and renders these tags according to markup strings and
rendering callbacks that it has been given during parser creation.

Usage
=====

xbbcode.js creates an XBBCode class, which is also its only export.
(This way, the module can be used both via `require()` and by simple inclusion
in a web page.)

To create a parser, this class is instantiated with a single argument
containing the mapping of BBCode tags to output, in the form of `plugins`
described below:

    plugins   ::= { name : renderer }*
    name      ::= string (must match /[A-Za-z0-9_-]+/)
    renderer  ::= string | function

A string renderer consists of any text with the following optional placeholders:
`{content}`, `{option}`, `{name}`, `{attribute.*}` or `{source} for any attribute name.

* In `[tag1=abc]xyz[/tag1]`, `{option}` is `abc` and `{content}` is `xyz`.
* In `[tag2 abc="xyz"][tag3][/tag3][/tag2]`, `{attribute.abc}` is `xyz`,
  `{source}` is `[tag3][/tag3]`, and `{content}` is whatever `[tag3][/tag3]`
  is rendered as.

The `{name}` placeholder is replaced with the tag name.

A function renderer receives a BBCodeElement instance as its only argument.
This object has the following methods, whose return values match the values
in the previous section:

- getName()
- getContent()
- getOption()
- getAttribute(key)
- getSource()

Sample
------

    const XBBCode = require('xbbcode');
    const filter = XBBCode.create({
      b:     '<strong>{content}</strong>',
      quote: '<q>{content}</q>',
      code:  '<code>{content}</code>',
      url:   tag =>
        (`<a href="http://example.com/outgoing?url=${encodeURI(tag.getOption())}">`
        + tag.getContent()
        + '</a>'),
      img:   '<img src="{source}" alt="Image({source}" />',
    });

    input = '[quote][code][url=http://example.org/][img]http://example.org/[b]image[/b].png[/img][/code][/url][/quote]';
    console.log(filter(input));

    // Note that the [url] tag is improperly nested; it closes after the [code] tag.
    // It will therefore not be rendered, to avoid generating improperly
    // nested output markup.
    // The [img] tag is set not to allow BBCode inside it,
    // Which prevents the [b] tag from being rendered.
    // "<q><code>[url=http://example.org/]<img src="http://example.org/[b]image[/b].png" /></a></code>[/url]</q>"

The recommended way to use xbbcode.js is to import the `src/xbbcode.js` file.

On legacy platforms, it may be necessary to run `make`, which uses Babel to
translate the file to a pre-ES2015 syntax, and then use `./xbbcode.js` in the
root folder.
